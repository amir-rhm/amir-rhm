<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Amir 👋</h1>

<p align="center">
  I'm a developer who cares about fundamentals — not just using tools, but really understanding them.
</p>

---

### 🚀 About Me

- I go deep. I don’t learn tools by memorizing commands — I learn how they work.
- Right now I’m focused on mastering Git, frontend architecture, and real-world DevOps.
- My goal is to become the kind of developer who can pick up any tech stack fast — because the foundations are solid.

---

### 🧠 How I Think

- Code is not magic. It’s systems, logic, and design.
- I care about clarity, structure, and solving real problems — not fancy buzzwords.
- Tools change. Good thinking doesn’t.
